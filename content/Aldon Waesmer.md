 A former [[Sea Elves|sea elf]] Admiral, Aldon was sent by his king to attack The Rock, a [[The Federation of Unified Tribes Overview|Federation]] ship, which was trespassing on Sea Elf territory. After a lengthy battle with The Rock, he was eventually talked down by [[Danzook Flamewillow]]. With a peaceful resolution he allowed the crew of The Rock to join his ship and helped them complete their quest. After this [[The Cleansing of The Moschemia Isle|quest]] was over he and his crew moved to the town of [[Barme]] and with the help of Danzook and his assistant [[Coil]] they built homes for the entire Sea Elf crew under his command. He lived out the rest of his life in Barme.

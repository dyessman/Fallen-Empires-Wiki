The Brudia City Thieves Guild was originally formed alongside [[Brudia City]]. Originally merely committing petty crimes such as stealing trinkets from nobles to sell and using the money to help the less fortunate. The Guild evolved into a massive criminal enterprise, conducting massive heists from high profile targets. Believing The Guild to have lost sight of their purpose to help those of the lower classes, [[Yorbin Remere]] eventually transformed The Guild once more, this time into the governing body of an underground refuge city called [[Sanctuary|Sanctuary.]] 61, 4th Era, The Guild had been considered a shadow of it's former self by most above ground, and saviors to the residents of Sanctuary.

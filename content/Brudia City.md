Brudia City is the first city made by the Brudia family in the Union of Brudia, and also the Capital City of the Union of Brudia. It's often called "The Gateway of Casmia." It's divided into 9 districts, including The District of Unity, Daybreak Gate, Darktide Gate, The Palace District, The Western City, Skywind Gate, Far Walk, The Eastern City, and Daggerlight. Generally these districts act as miniature cities themselves, often containing their own marketplaces, homes, churches and alike. This makes the city as a whole seem like a disorganized mish-mash, something the local residents often express mixed emotions on.

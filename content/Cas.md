The Casmian God of Creation, Cas, created the continent of [[Casmia]] as well as all of it's inhabitants. Unlike their [[Panazian God of Creation|Panazian Counterpart]], Cas played an active role in the affairs of the Dawn Era Elves, which led to religion being a large part of Casmian Culture. Though now they're not extraordinarily present, the gods under his wing continue to play active roles in Casmia through Paladins and Clerics.

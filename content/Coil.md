 Coil is a [[Warforged]], a rare mechanical wonder. They are fabled by the many to be as old as [[Panazia]] itself, however not even they are sure of how old they are, as they suffer from memory loss involving their first few years of existence. They found themselves struggling to find purpose and spent many years searching for their creator. At a certain point in their life they took on a Robin Hood type persona and found themselves stealing from the wealthy across [[Kingdom of Extabashan Overview|Extabashan]]. Although they enjoyed helping others, they always felt lost and directionless. 20 years ago their crime spree was put to an end, after being caught by the newly forming [[The Federation of Unified Tribes Overview|Federation of Unified Tribes]], they were sent to prison for a short time. However it was merely a week before [[Danzook Flamewillow]] freed Coil and took them under his wing. Though at first a skeptic, Coil eventually found themselves very pleased with their life assisting Danzook, and happily remained with him throughout many years of change. 
 
 In 18, 3rd Era, Coil, alongside Danzook and an [[Aasimar]] by the name of [[Eldrele]], was instrumental in [[The Cleansing of The Moschemia Isle]].

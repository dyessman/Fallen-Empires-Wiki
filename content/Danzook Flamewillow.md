 Danzook Flamewillow was a human mage born to the Dichidia Tribe in the late 2nd Era. He had a natural talent for the magics and became a powerful mage at a young age. As he aged, he found himself becoming a revered Wiseman for his tribe, which upon their joining of the [[The Federation of Unified Tribes Overview|Federation]] in 3, 3rd Era, he was given a great deal of respect in the leadership of the Federation. In his latter years of life he found himself struggling to correctly cast magic, or keep up with life very well. However his kindness is one thing that never faltered. He took [[Coil]], a [[warforged]] thief, under his wing after they were imprisoned for helping the unfortunate of [[Panazia]]. Coil became his most trusted assistant quickly as the two grew a bond over the books of old magics and the wonders of history. This kind gesture is one of many over the years that led to his tribes growth, as well as the admiration his tribe had for the old man. 
 
 In 18, 3rd Era, Danzook, alongside Coil, and an [[Aasimar]] by the name of [[Eldrele]], was instrumental in [[The Cleansing of The Moschemia Isle]].

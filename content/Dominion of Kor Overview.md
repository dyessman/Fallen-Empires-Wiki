 The Dominion of Kor was formed in the mid 2nd Era when the [[Declaration of Dominion]] was signed by [[Zeymond Hern]] and seventy-odd tribal chiefs. It is structured similarly to [[Kingdom of Extabashan Overview|Extabashan]]'s government in the fact that it's ruled by an elected monarch, however the monarch does serve a board of Governors which has the power to overrule anything they deem unfair.

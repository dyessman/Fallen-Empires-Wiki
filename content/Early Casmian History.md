Early Casmian history is much more well documented than that of early humanity, thanks in no small part to the Casmian God of Creation; Cas. For much of the Dawn Era, The Elven Empire was the first civilization to arise, and it stood for most of this history. The Church of Cas arose alongside it, and much of the documentation can be attributed to the early church. In the human equivalent to the mid 2nd Era, after many years of growing distant, the Church of Cas, with an army of clerics and paladins from across the Casmian Pantheon, began a coup de tat of The Elven Empire across the Nation. From the ashes arose The Casmian Divine Empire. The Holy Takeover, as it is called now, marks the end of what scholars now call "Early Casmian History."

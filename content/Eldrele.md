Eldrele was a [[Fallen Guardians|fallen guardian]] [[Aasimar]]. After failing her god, Eldrele was stripped of her Celestial status, and banished to the mortal realm. Thinking herself hopeless, she began to wander from bar to bar drinking her woes away. Before long, in 16, 3rd Era, she came across the town of [[Barme]], where a Scholarly Mage, [[Danzook Flamewillow]], managed to help Eldrele make a home for herself in the small tribal town. While living in Barme she eventually found herself embarking on a [[The Cleansing of The Moschemia Isle|legendary quest]] with Danzook and his [[Warforged]] assistant [[Coil]]. This quest led to her regaining her celestial status, as well as her death at the hands of the [[Vampires|vampire]] [[Lord Damilius]]. Her body was Later buried in Barme by Coil and Danzook.

Half Elves, though technically in name is any race which is Half-Elven, in truth is almost always exclusively used to refer to those whom are Half-Elven and Half-Human. This race, in the past, has been outcasted and discriminated against, deemed too inhuman, but not truly elven. In recent times, many have found a home in the Union of Brudia. Across this nation, half Elves have finally begun to form a unique cultural identity.

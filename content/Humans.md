 "Godless humans." Many races call them. The ancient history of Humanity's origins has been long lost, covered up by it's thousands of years of war and conquest. Between the fabled Expansion Wars of the 1st Era, to the Konoren Conflict, Humanity is often accused of being reckless and power hungry, however most scholars blame the many wars on humanity's historic lack of democracy in it's home of Panazia. Humanity's culture is defined by it's atheism, as well is it's large gaps between it's high and low classes, with very few comfortably in the middle.

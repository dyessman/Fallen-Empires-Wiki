Thadarin was the King of Extabashan during the late 2nd Era. His hostile nature is often blamed for [[The War of Kor]], as well as [[The First Colonial War]]. Although at first loved, by the end of his rule he and his family was prematurely ousted from royalty by the noble families of Extabashan. He and [[Prince Thios]], his 2nd son and leader of [[The New Kingdom of Extabashan Overview|New Extabashan,]] were both exiled to the Panazia Mountains shortly after the two wars of the 2nd Era were ended.

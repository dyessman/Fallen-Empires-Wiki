Thadarin was the King of Extabashan during the late 2nd Era. His hostile nature is often blamed for the War of Kor, as well as the First Colonial War. Although at first loved, by the end of his Rule he and his family was prematurely ousted from royalty by the noble families of Extabashan. He and Prince Thios, his 2nd son and leader of New Extabashan, were both exiled to the Panazia Mountains shortly after the two wars of the 2nd Era were ended.

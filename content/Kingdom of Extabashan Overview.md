 The Kingdom of Extabashan is the oldest Empire in all of [[Panazia]]. It's government has always been rather simple in structure, a single monarch, which is elected for life, serves the people. Though over time the power the monarch holds has slowly been delegated to chosen advisors, ultimately all that happens in Extabashan goes through the monarch.

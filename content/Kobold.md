Natives to Panzia, the Kobold are often described as "capable as they are small." Rarely being much more than 2 feet in height, Kobold have had a shocking amount of presence in Panazian History. Though not often mentioned in the stories of history, at any point in history where there is conflict, it can be assumed they were fighting side by side with humans. However, sometime during The Eternal War, many decided to disassociate with human society, believing it too conflict driven. By the 4th Era Kobold mainly reside in small villages across Panazia, forming their own cultural identity as more religious driven and peaceful. This has made them favorites of the goddess [[Mephina]].

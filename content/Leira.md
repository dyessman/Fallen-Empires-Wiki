Leira, the God of Deception, or sometimes called the Lady of Mists, is one which perplexes theological scholars. She seems to have no followers, though people have been known to receive visions from her, and she has even been rumored to make physical appearances at times. Some theorize her purpose is to influence from the shadows, some believe she is a rogue god who merely seeks to instill chaos in the lands across the world.

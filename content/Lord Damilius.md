 Lord Damilius was a [[Vampires|vampire]] lord that made his home in the Moschemia Isle. He used dark magics to corrupt the island and surrounding seas, supposedly to serve a master of some sort. He, alongside this corruption, was brought to an end in 18, 3rd Era, when [[Coil]] delivered him a killing blow, shortly after the Lord killed [[Eldrele]]. This became a widely known legend called [[The Cleansing of The Moschemia Isle]].

 Luporians are a semi-draconic humanoid race. They are well known for adaptation as their homeland is unforgiving to life. Nearly their entire anatomy has been evolved to be a tool. Despite much adaptation they have retained many traits from their draconic origin, such as their fire breath and their horns, both of which have become culturally significant to the Luporians.

Homeland: Surian

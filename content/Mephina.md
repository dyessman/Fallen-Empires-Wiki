Mephina, the Panazian Goddess of Peace, is similar to most Panazian god's with her cryptic and hands off approach with her followers. However, unlike said other God's, she is very selective on who may serve her as a cleric/paladin. Often known to choose children who grow up in small towns close to forests, particularly those of eastern Panazia. Though her pantheon is that of the lost Panazian god, her followers often travel worldwide in attempt to spread peace across the world.

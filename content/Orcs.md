 Native to the Panazia Mountains, Orcs are a people who pride themselves on tradition. In order to become an adult in the Orcish society, one must embark on a hunt. Whichever animal is killed on this hunt becomes the Orc's title, as well as their role in Orcish society. In the mainlands of Panazia the orcs are a rare sight, typically seen as mercenaries and merchants, either serving their clan or themselves.

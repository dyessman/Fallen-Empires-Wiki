 Once the Panazia Empire fell, the Separatists found themselves directionless. Their army was mostly farmers from the rural east, who participated in Guerilla Warfare in attempt to remain independent from the rule of the Panazia Empire. Eventually the remains of the Separatists into the south-easternmost part of the known lands and began to create large cities. Eventually these cities unified under one banner, the Imperium. Led by 4 kings, the Imperium claimed to own all the lands east of Numa. This came in conflict with the Kingdom of Extabashan which also claimed to own these lands, as well as all the known lands. 
 
 Eventually in 100, 2nd Era this led to a war which was very quickly ended in the span of 20 years. The Imperium proved to stand no chance to the immense military might of the Kingdom as the war changed from offense to defensive after the first battle. Although they stood no chance, the Imperium did not let Extabashan win easily. Some battles spanned more than entire year. The Imperium was destroyed in 120, 2nd Era.
 
When the Imperium fell, one king, Kor Sloban, was exiled to the uncharted lands west of the Panazia mountains. In 5 short years he more than 20 tribes of these lands under his banner, and began to build Uvasfelle. The home of his new Empire. He however, did not live to see his Empire come to fruition. He was killed in 132, 2nd Era, when an assassin hired by Extabashan's king, ended Kor's life. His close friend, Zeymond Hern, gathered 50 tribes and signed "The Declaration of Dominion." This document is the official historical mark of the formation of The Dominion of Kor.

This Dominion went forth in 133, 2nd Era, to attack the westernmost portion of the Kingdom of Extabashan, claiming several cities under their banner. Having shown their power, the Kingdom mobilized their full military to the western border. For 17 years both powers held their line in a war of attrition. Finally in 150, 2nd Era, they signed a treaty, ending the bloodshed, and marking the End of the 2nd Era.

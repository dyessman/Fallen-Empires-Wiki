The story of the 1st Era is the story of The Panazia Empire, the first continental power of Human History

The Panazia Empire was an ancient power, which the formation of marked the transition from the Dawn Era to the 1st Era. It was formed when Dom-Zeor Ing first took over the city of Numa. He declared himself King of Panazia and began to conquest the known lands. His conquests spanned the entirety of the 1st Era, carried on through generations by his descendants. However around 450, 1st Era, the massive Panazia Empire proved unsustainable. 

It shattered into 2 factions, the Loyalists, based in Numa, and Separatists, based in the rural east. In 475, 1st Era, a 3rd faction arose in the west. Led by Romovo Nab, a former lieutenant of the Ing family, the Extabashan Rebellion was formed. Eventually in 500, 1st Era, the Extabashan Rebellion proved victorious when they took Numa. The Panazia Empire was reformed into the Kingdom of Extabashan. Marking the end of the 1st Era.

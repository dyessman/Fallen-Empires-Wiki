 Not too many years after the signing of the Extabashan-Kor treaty, a new power began to appear. In the then unmapped lands South East to the Panazia Mountains, the [[The Federation of Unified Tribes Overview|Federation of Unified Tribes]] rose to power. By 13, 3rd Era, they had unified any and all remaining human tribes of Panazia, which meant their reach of power was far and wide. In 14, 3rd Era, the first chief of the Unified Tribes was overthrown by [[Satsuma Reyn]], the chief of the largest tribe. Satsuma was infamous for being power hungry, and he proved this reputation accurate when in 16, 3rd era, only 3 years after the formation of the Unified Tribes, he personally led an [[The Unified Tribes War|attack on the eastern portion of the Dominion of Kor.]] 

This took the still recovering military of [[Dominion of Kor Overview|Kor]] off guard, and the Unified Tribes made considerable gains into Dominion territory. However the tables quickly turned in Kor's favor, as several guilds and factions consisting of warriors for hire, mages, and assassin's, banded together to protect the people of Kor. These factions held off the Unified Tribes for about a year, until finally in 17, 3rd Era, Kor's military won a decisive battle and turned the war in their favor. At this point the King of Kor officially provided funding to all the guilds participating in the war in exchange for their continued service. This proved to be an extremely important decision as within 3 years the Unified Tribes were pushed back to their capitol city.

Satsuma Reyn was killed in 20, 3rd era, in the Unified Tribes capitol. This led the Unified Tribes to officially surrender. Their government already being weak without the loss of their leader, the remaining chiefs of the Unified Tribes agreed to dissolve into the Dominion of Kor, expanding the reach of Kor to cover most of the land south of the Panazia Mountains.

During the Unified Tribes War, [[Kingdom of Extabashan Overview|Extabashan]] enjoyed a cultural surge. The area around [[Numa]] began to have a huge surge in population, and the eastern rural areas had an economic surge as new farming techniques began to yield far superior results. Eventually in 13, 3rd Era, Extabashan invested in building up the cities to the east, most notably [[Sterok]]. Sterok and the surrounding cities became the largest trade hubs in Extabashan quickly and, in 23, 3rd Era, they soared into the largest area in all of Panazia as they initiated trade with Kor. 

Meanwhile, in the years following the Unified Tribes War, Kor began a long process of rebuilding, recovering, as well as expanding into their new territory. In 23, 3rd era, they built the city of [[Konoren City|Konoren]] in a strip of habitable land in the mountains. This city allowed them to begin trade with Extabashan, both in their northern area close to Numa, as well as their eastern area around Sterok.

For more than 200 years Panazia had peace. Both Extabashan and Kor enjoyed large jumps in stability, power, and economic reach. After thousands of years of constant war and bloodshed, Panazia had peace and stability. This however was not meant to last...

Despite the era of stability, Extabashan and Kor's peace was always a very fragile one. In the 238th year of the 3rd Era, after nearly a quarter of a millennium of peace, [[The Eternal War|war broke out between Extabashan and Kor.]] Historical scholars to this day are unsure what broke the peace, nor are they sure which side attacked first. The only thing known is that this war defined the 3rd Era.

For more than 300 years these two factions waged war. For most of the war the soldiers, as well as the commanders leading it, had no idea what they were fighting for. All they knew is that the other side was the enemy. In 591, 3rd era, commanders of the eastern forces on both sides, fed up with fighting a war for their ancestors, banded together and mutinied. The collective force of both militaries managed to take Sterok as well as the largest surrounding cities.

This event led them to forming the [[League of Free-Cities Overview|League of Free-Cities]], led by an elected council of the people, the first democracy in human history. In 594, 3rd Era, after 2 and a half years of defending their claim to the cities, the Free-Cities council reached out to the kings of Extabashan and Kor, in an attempt to end the war.

The Treaty of Sterok was signed in the waning days of 594, 3rd era. It officially established the League as a legitimate power, as well as clearly defined territory for all 3 powers. The terms of the treaty were agreed upon and after 321 years of war, peace was reached in Panazia once again, ending the 3rd Era.

The Panazian God of Creation is sometimes referred to as "The Forgotten God." Though theological scholars tend to agree they exist, it in truth is an educated guess that they do. The working theory is that during the [[Overview of The Panazian Dawn Era|Dawn Era]], [[Humans|humanity]], being the largest race population wise, became too caught up in conquest and personal glory, that the God, as well as most of their pantheon, was forgotten to time. The Gods under the Panazian Pantheon tend to be indirect with how they interact with their followers, often communicating through messages and symbols rather than words, and never actually showing themselves in any physical figure.

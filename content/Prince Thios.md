Second son of [[King Thadarin]] and first ruler of the [[New Kingdom of Extabashan]], Prince Thios is often characterized as a fool hardy child given too much power. Like his father, his hostile nature is blamed for [[The First Colonial War]] in [[Casmia]]. As part of the peace agreement he was sent back to [[Panazia]] to face trial with his father, and the highest ranking military officials took power of New Extabashan. The trial results in him and his father being exiled to the Panazia Mountains, as well as his family being usurped as the Royal Family of [[Kingdom of Extabashan Overview|Extabashan]].

Built in the early 4th Era, it was brought to prominence by [[Yorbin Remere||Yorbin Remere,]] the second leader of the [[Brudia City Thieves Guild]]. The Guild would be the main group in charge of the area until the 15th of Contendunt, 61, 4th Era, when the town was [[The Sacking of Sanctuary|attacked]] and the Guild's leadership structure collapsed.

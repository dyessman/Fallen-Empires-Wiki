 Satsuma Reyn was the Chief of the [[The Federation of Unified Tribes Overview|Unified Tribes]] during the latter stages of it's existence. He was known for being a manipulative leader and one focused on personal glory. Prime examples of this was his war with the [[Dominion of Kor Overview|Dominion of Kor]] - which led to the collapse of the Unified Tribes - and [[The Cleansing of The Moschemia Isle]], which although being a successful campaign, he found himself unable to fullfil his promise to those he recruited to take on the quest, as he promised something the Unified Tribes were not able to accomplish in their current state. He was killed during the final battles of the Unified Tribes War.

 In the 18th year of the third era, [[Satsuma Reyn]] departs to the small village of [[Barme]] in the southern regions of the [[The Federation of Unified Tribes Overview|Federation of Unified Tribes]]. In this village he recruits three heroes, the [[Humans|human]] mage [[Danzook Flamewillow]], the [[Warforged]] rogue [[Coil]], and the [[Aasimar]] Cleric [[Eldrele]]. These three heroes would go on to embark on a mighty quest to claim the Moschemia Isle.

Shortly after they set sail into the open seas they were attacked by a gang of [[Sea Elves]] led by [[Aldon Waesmer]], however thanks to their strength of negotiation They were able to convince the sea elves to join them in their quest. As they inched closer to the aisle slowly but surely they realized that the air around them was cursed with a thick fog magic which drained them of their energies. however our heroes did not falter on their faith.

They marched forward to this castle and faced off against the mighty [[Lord Damilius]], a [[Vampires|Vampires]] lord which had ruled over the entire isle for several centuries. The Lord cast a spell on them and forced them into a plain or existence where they faced off with their personal demons. Danzook came to terms with his age and finally looked death in the eye and said he would be ready for when it came for him. Coil finally accepted that they had purpose with their friends in their new life, and that they did not need a creator to show them their purpose. Eldrele finally accepted her own failure and was redeemed in the eyes that the celestials she once served, and was granted the powers of an angel once more.

After facing off their own personal demons they faced the Lord Damilius himself. After a long and costly fight against him, Eldrele sacrificed herself to discover how to rid the aisle of the evil of Damilius. Coil delivered the finishing blow to lord, and Danzook destroyed the castle around them finally freeing the isle of his dark magic. Thus these three heroes secured their place in the stories of legends.

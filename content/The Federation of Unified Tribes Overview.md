 The Federation of Unified Tribes was a government formed by the unification of the remaining [[Humans|human]] tribes which lived on land unclaimed by any Empire. It initially was a peaceful government, covering most of southeastern [[Panazia]], however it was short lived as when [[Satsuma Reyn]] assumed power as chief of these tribes he declared war on [[Dominion of Kor Overview|The Dominion]], with hopes to claim personal glory. This led to the Federation's government being taken over and it's land being annexed by The Dominion.

Upon arrival, these people formed The [[The New Kingdom of Extabashan Overview|New Kingdom of Extabashan]], which at the time of its formation consisted solely of the city of [[New Numa]]. Within months, Thadarin's second child, [[Prince Thios]], proclaimed himself the leader of this new nation, and began to use its militaries to expand. this expansion did not go unnoticed by [[The Casmian Divine Empire Overview|The Casmian Divine Empire]], which by now has existed for near on 40 years. Scholars are still unsure the exact date which the conflicted escalated from conflict to full blown war, as it was a very gradual escalation of intensity. However, the war by it's peak in the 140's of the 2nd Era, was just as, if not more bloody than the [[The War of Kor]] happening across the seas. In 150, 2nd Era, the Divine Empire having lost a significant portion of their military, and Extabashan being stretched thin between fighting two wars, signed a treaty. This treaty defined borders definitively and brokered a peace between the two nations.

 For 34 years, Panazia rebuilt. All 3 nations being severely weakened by war, a mutually beneficial trade was established. Panazia began to stabilize once more and by 34, 4th Era, all 3 Nations were at a relatively stable place.

In 36, 4th era, this stability led to bravado. A commander of the Extabashan Military led a brutal attack on the city of Konoren. The Queen of Extabashan denounced this attack, calling the commander a "rogue party." Regardless this attack sent shockwaves across Panazia. Konoren, feeling failed by the Dominion of Kor, declared independence. It being one of the largest cities in Kor, it's political sway was strong enough to earn its independence without military intervention. The battle, as well as Konoren's separation from Kor, was dubbed the Konoren Conflict. And it's effects are still happening to this day.

The Union of Brudia is a nation often described as one of unity. Being built off the back of diversity, it attracts refugees from wars, people looking for a better life, and any and all kinds of people in between. Initially led by the Brudia Family, it was eventually turned into a democracy, where a council of elected Senators collectively rule over the nation.

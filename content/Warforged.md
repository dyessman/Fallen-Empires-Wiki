 Warforged are a rare mechanical wonder that typically takes a humanoid shape. How they came about is unclear, and there is great mystery behind their origin. [[Coil]] is a notable warforged as they were the first to have interacted with humanity. Over time more have come to join society but they remain a rarity in [[Panazia]].

The Panazia Calendar works similar to ours. 7 days a week, 12 months a year. In the mid 3rd Era, during the brief era of peace, it was agreed upon by scholars of both the Dominion and Extabashan how to keep track of dates. They worked with historians to separate groups of years into [[Era's Index|Era's]], starting at the formation of the [[Panazia Empire Overview|Panazia Empire]], creating the calendar used today. As of the start of the 4th Era, it was officially adopted by the nations of [[Casmia]] as well.
